            const comment = `👋 Hello! Before merging this PR, you can use the \`run-gds\` label to start the GDS workflow.
            
            ⚠️ **Important:** The GDS workflow takes a long time (~1 hour) and consumes significant CI runtime quota.
            
            **Before running the GDS workflow:**
            1. Make sure you've run the hardening command locally first:
               \`\`\`bash
               ./tt/tt_tool.py --harden
               \`\`\`
            2. Verify that the hardening command succeeded without errors
            
            **To run the GDS workflow:**
            - Add the \`run-gds\` label to this PR
            - The workflow will run automatically
            - It will also re-run on subsequent pushes while the label remains attached
            
            📚 For more information about the hardening command, see the [TinyTapeout GDS Action](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-gds-action/blob/ttsky25b/action.yml#L85-L87).`;
